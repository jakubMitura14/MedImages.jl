OntologyGen is a web-based framework that automates OWL ontology generation from MongoDB databases,
using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Built with Python and Django, It extracts a formal context from NoSQL
data, builds concept lattices, and applies rule-based mappings to produce OWL ontologies. OntologyGen offers
an interactive graphical interface that requires less user involvement, allows the user to extract semantic
structures from schema-flexible data, and then builds OWL ontologies that can be used with other existing
tools. By using two publicly available MongoDB datasets of varying complexity, the framework’s usability
and efficacy were established, with a subsequent assessment of performance metrics including execution time,
memory footprint, and ontology size. It was concluded that OntologyGen represents a considerable opportunity
to reduce the difficulty of ontology engineering for data scientists and domain experts, while also providing
scalability, interoperability, and extensibility beyond the current implementation with other NoSQL systems
or possible future ontology learning extensions.

1. Introduction
As organizations are increasingly looking to NoSQL document-
oriented databases, there are new challenges for semantic data mod-
eling and ontology engineering. In contrast to more traditional rela-
tional systems, NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, are schema-less,
therefore providing flexibility in your data structure at the cost of
formal representation. With the increasing amount of loosely struc-
tured data organizations are collecting, there is a need for tools that

can automatically convert that data into formal machine-readable
ontologies.
As organizations are increasingly adopting NoSQL document-
oriented databases there also comes new challenges in terms of seman-
tic data modeling and ontology engineering. NoSQL databases such as
MongoDB are schema-less as compared to more traditional relational
systems. This schema-less architecture allows users’ flexibility with
less formal representation of their data. With the growing amount of
loosely structured data organizations are collecting, it is important

to acquire tools that can automatically convert that data into formal
machine-readable ontologies.
OntologyGen has a user interface that collaborates towards simplic-
ity and interpretability. The intermediate stages of the transformation
from raw data into semantic knowledge are visualized, guiding the
users through the structural changes. Generated OWL files can immedi-
ately be used in standard ontology tools, which can enable downstream
work including reasoning, querying and integration.
This papers describes the design, and implementation, of Ontolo-
gyGen, including the core methodology and system architecture. The
tool is evaluated on two real-world MongoDB datasets with different
complexities to evaluate its performance, expressiveness, and general-
izability. Also included is a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses
of the tool along with directions for future development.
The rest of this paper consists of the following sections: Section 2
discusses prior related work concerning ontology learning and FCA
techniques. Section 3 explains the motivation and importance of de-
veloping OntologyGen. Section 4 gives background on Formal Concept
Analysis (FCA). Section 5 describes the software architecture and key
features. Section 6 describes the sequential workflow of the tool. Sec-
tion 7 presents an example from a live MongoDB dataset. Section 8
evaluates a number of datasets and evaluation criteria of the system.
Section 9 discusses broader implications and positional comparisons
about OntologyGen. Finally, Section 10 will summarize conclusions and
directions for future work.
2. Related work
Ontology engineering and database mining have long been studied
in both relational and NoSQL contexts. Early work reversed relational
schemas into ontologies, such as Chiang et al. [1], who recovered
Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) models, and Ding and Feng [2],
who transformed relational structures into OWL via schema matching.
These methods work for structured data but are less effective for
heterogeneous NoSQL sources.
For MongoDB, Jabbari and Stoffel [3] extracted field types to form
context attributes, while Abbes et al. introduced M2Onto [4], map-
ping document structures to OWL classes and properties. Such systems
generated ontologies but lacked reasoning based on Formal Concept
Analysis (FCA).
FCA, formalized by Ganter and Wille [5], derives class hierarchies
from object–attribute relations. Fu [6] and Baader & Sertkaya [7] ap-
plied FCA to ontology generation and description logics, while Sertkaya
[8] highlighted its value for DL-based models. Other tools, like CB2Onto
[9] for Couchbase and C2Ont [10] for Cassandra, automate ontology
learning but rely on fixed schemas. Distributed FCA methods—RD-
FCA by Khaund et al. [11] and Spark-based approaches by Baixeries
et al. [12]—improve scalability but target large-scale processing rather
than interactive prototyping. Hassan et al. [13] enriched FCA-based
ontologies with WordNet semantics without extra complexity. FCA-
Merge by Stumme & Maedche [14] used a bottom-up strategy to
merge ontologies, unlike OntologyGen, which builds new ones from
schema-less data.
Extensions of FCA expand its scope, including fuzzy FCA for graded
attributes [15], relational context families for complex relational data
[16], and fuzzy relational context families [17]. These represent future
directions for enhancing OntologyGen.
To the best of our knowledge, OntologyGen is the only lightweight,
web-based FCA-driven framework for MongoDB. It integrates context
extraction, lattice generation, and mapping rules into a transparent
pipeline, making ontology building accessible for education, experi-
mentation, and small- to medium-scale use.
3. Motivation and significance
NoSQL systems such as MongoDB challenge semantic integration
due to their semi-structured nature, complicating automatic ontology
generation. Few tools address this with a clear, user-friendly solution.
OntologyGen was developed to let non-experts transform MongoDB
instances into OWL ontologies through a simple web interface, without
scripting or ontology editors. The workflow supports dataset upload,
context extraction, and OWL export in a transparent, stepwise process.

By abstracting technical complexity, OntologyGen serves a wide
user base—from engineers to educators—providing a lightweight frame-
work for experimentation, learning, and semantic modeling in NoSQL
contexts.
4. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) background
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework based
on lattice and order theory for data mining and knowledge representa-
tion. Introduced by Ganter and Wille (1999), it identifies structured re-
lations between objects and their attributes, supporting the systematic
discovery of conceptual hierarchies and dependencies.
A formal context in FCA is a triple (G, M, I), where:
• G is a set of objects.
• M is a set of attributes.
• I ⊆ G × M indicates which objects have which attributes.
From this formal context, FCA constructs formal concepts, each
represented as a pair (A, B), where:
• A is the set of all objects (extent) sharing the attributes in B.
• B is the set of attributes (intent) common to all objects in A.
Concepts are partially ordered by inclusion, forming a concept
lattice that inherently captures hierarchical relationships. This structure
underpins the derivation of ontological constructs such as classes,
subclasses, and properties. Key advantages of FCA include:
• Automatic discovery of latent hierarchies in data.
• Representation of disjointness and subsumption without manual
intervention.
• Handling incomplete or sparse attributes, useful for semi-
structured databases like MongoDB.
In OntologyGen, FCA transforms MongoDB data into a semantic struc-
ture: the tool extracts the formal context from schema and sample data,
builds the concept lattice, and maps it into OWL ontology constructs.
This ensures a robust, explainable, and consistent ontology generation
process.
5. Software description
OntologyGen is developed as a lightweight, web-based system to
automate the creation of OWL ontologies from MongoDB databases
using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The application is intended to
be simple, lightweight, and extensible, empowering users, irrespective
of their technical abilities, to generate semantic representations as
effortlessly as possible. This section describes the overall architecture,
implementation stack, and core components of the tool.

5.1. Architecture overview
OntologyGen is based on a three-tiered architecture within a Django
web framework:
• Presentation Layer : A web front end application that allows
the user to import data from MongoDB, visualize the formal
context and concept lattices, and export as OWL. Developed in
Django means it runs in any web browser, and provides a simple
multi-user experience with no installation required.
• Business Logic Layer : Implemented in Python, where the FCA
reasoning, lattice generation, and rule-based construction occurs.
The concepts are derived from Ganter’s algorithm [5] and mapped
to the OWL classes, properties, and datatypes.
• Data Access Layer : Where the MongoDB connectivity hap-
pens, schema reading occurs, and formal context is built using
PyMongo, exposing the logic layer from the data layer.
The modular approach provides easy maintainability, extensibility,
and integration with other databases.
5.2. Functionalities
OntologyGen features the following central functionality in its web
interface:
• Database Integration: Connects to MongoDB via a URI connec-
tion. Collections will be listed for navigation, allowing the user to
inspect the collections before generating the ontology.
• Automated Context Generation: Extracts binary relations be-
tween collections and attributes that can form the formal context
table. Collections will form as rows and attributes will be used as
columns. Attributes that belongs to a collection will be marked
with an ‘‘X’’, which forms at the end a table of binary relations
between collections and attributes.
• Concept Lattice Generation: After FCA processing to generate
the concept lattice from the context, all extents and intents along
with their hierarchical relations will be a part of the lattice
structure. The concept lattice will be available for clustering and
visualization.
• Ontology Construction Using Mapping Rules: OntologyGen
comes with predefined navigation rules that will transform the
concepts from the lattice to OWL classes, properties and datatypes,
ensuring consistent mapping.
• Export Options: The output ontology can be saved as an OWL file
and reused in editors like Protégé [18]. OntologyGen has been
tested on datasets of varying size, proving its scalability while
preserving consistency.
Together, these features transform raw MongoDB data into a struc-
tured lattice and OWL ontology with just a few steps, offering a
complete end-to-end workflow.
To assess the scalability of OntologyGen, we gathered measurements
of execution time, memory use, and ontology size against two datasets
of greater complexity. The outcomes, appearing in the Evaluation
section, illustrate the efficiency and scalability of the system.
6. Workflow steps
The OntologyGen tool follows a linear workflow from database
import to ontology export, hiding the underlying semantic process-
ing but ensuring each step complies with semantic web engineering
conventions. The process translates a large MongoDB instance into an
OWL ontology in six key stages, each mirrored in the web interface for
structured execution.
1. Database Connection and Import : Users connect to Mon-
goDB via a URI string. Once connected, the tool retrieves and
visualizes the schema.
2. Formal Context Generation : After schema loading, Ontolo-
gyGen creates a binary context table with entities as rows and
attributes as columns, marking presence with an ‘‘X.’’
3. Concept Lattice Generation and Visualization : FCA is ap-
plied to derive a lattice, where each node groups entities with
shared attributes. The lattice organizes concepts hierarchically
by generalization and specialization.
4. Ontology Mapping and Class Hierarchy Generation : Based
on the lattice, predefined FCA rules translate concepts into OWL
classes, properties, and hierarchies:
Rule 1: Single-Entity Class Generation
• Condition: If a formal concept 𝐶𝑖 has one element in
its extensional set (|𝐶𝑖| = 1), OntologyGen creates
an OWL class for that entity.
• Example: In a sample database, concepts like
[’𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑡’] and [’𝐴𝑙𝑏𝑢𝑚’] are mapped to distinct OWL
classes.
• OWL Syntax:
<owl:Class rdf:ID="Artist"/>
<owl:Class rdf:ID="Album"/>
Rule 2: Direct Object Relationship Binding
• Condition: If 𝐶𝑖 contains two elements (|𝐶𝑖| = 2)
and is directly linked to the root concept (Thing), an
object property is created between the two entities.
• Direct linkage: No intermediate concepts exist be-
tween 𝐶𝑖 and Thing.
• Example: The concept [Artist, Album] generates an
object property 𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑡𝐴𝑙𝑏𝑢𝑚𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑘 with [𝐴𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑡] as the
domain and [𝐴𝑙𝑏𝑢𝑚] as the range.
• OWL Syntax:
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="ArtistAlbumLink">
    <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Artist"/>
    <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Album"/>
</owl:ObjectProperty>
Rule 3: Intermediate Class Creation
• Condition: If 𝐶𝑖 contains two elements |𝐶𝑖| = 2)
but is indirectly linked to Thing (via intermediate
concepts), OntologyGen creates a new composite
class.
Rule 4: Attribute-to-Property Conversion
• Condition: Attributes in the intentional part of a
concept 𝐶𝑖 (e.g., ArtistId, Name) are mapped to
datatype properties of the corresponding ontological
class.
• OWL Syntax:
<owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:ID="ArtistId">
    <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Artist">
    <rdfs:range rdf:resource="&xsd;int"/>
</owl:DatatypeProperty>
Rule 5: Hierarchical Inheritance Derivation
• Condition: Subclass relationships are inferred from
the concept lattice. If 𝐶𝑖 is a direct sub-concept of
𝐶𝑗 , OntologyGen assigns 𝐶𝑖 as a subclass of 𝐶𝑗 .
• Example: Artist becomes a subclass of Thing.
• OWL Syntax:
<owl:Class rdf="Artist">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#thing"/>
</owl:Class>
SoftwareX 32 (2025) 102333
3 E. Elguerraoui et al.
Rule 6: Class Disjointness Enforcement
• Condition: All generated classes are inherently dis-
joint. Formal concepts in FCA ensure no overlap
between extensional sets, guaranteeing ontological
disjointness.
Rule 7: Bidirectional Property Inference
• Condition: For every object property 𝑃𝑖𝑗 , Ontology-
Gen automatically generates its inverse 𝑃𝑗𝑖
• Example: AlbumToTrack is inferred as the inverse of
TrackToAlbum.
• OWL Syntax:
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:ID="AlbumToTrack">
<owl:inverseOf rdf:resource="#TrackToAlbum"/>
</owl:ObjectProperty>
Rule 8: Cardinality Constraint Assignment
• Condition: Datatype properties are assigned cardi-
nality bounds based on null value occurrences.
• Example: If ArtistId has no null values, it receives
minCardinality=1.
• OWL Syntax:
<owl:Restriction>
    <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#ArtistId"/>
    <owl:minCardinality>1</owl:minCardinality>
    <owl:maxCardinality>1</owl:maxCardinality>
</owl:Restriction>
Rule 9: Nested Entity Individualization
• Condition: Attributes with nested object values are
mapped to sub-classes or individuals.
• Example: A nested Address document becomes an
individual of a class Address linked to its parent
entity.
The current rule set supports standard object and datatype
property translation, class disjointness, cardinality detec-
tion and individuals extractions. Future work includes
extending rule coverage for richer semantic constructs
and edge cases.
5. Ontology Graph Visualization : The tool depicts the ontology
as a graph of class hierarchies and relationships. Solid arrows
denote subclass links; dashed arrows denote object properties.
6. OWL Ontology Export : Finally, the ontology is exported in
OWL (RDF/XML) format, with an option to download for reuse
in external tools.
OntologyGen thus produces a structured ontology that represents
MongoDB data while leveraging FCA reasoning for mapping and hier-
archy generation. Workflow robustness was validated on two datasets:
Chinook (medium complexity) and Sample Training (larger, diverse).
Results are detailed in the Evaluation section.
7. Illustrative example
To assess OntologyGen’s practical value, we applied the workflow
to the Chinook MongoDB database, a digital music store with data on
artists, albums, tracks, customers, invoices, and related entities. This
case study illustrates the end-to-end process and resulting ontology.
We began by importing a JSON dump of Chinook. OntologyGen
connected and identified 11 collections (Fig.  1). It then generated the
formal context table, listing attributes per collection—for example,
Artist with ArtistId and Name; Album with AlbumId, Title, ArtistId; and
Track with TrackId, Name, AlbumId. Shared fields such as Id, Name,
and foreign keys (CustomerId, EmployeeId) are visible in the matrix
view (Fig.  2).
The tool next constructed the concept lattice, showing hierarchical
relations. Album and Track group under AlbumId, while Customer and
Employee share address-related attributes. The most specific concepts
appear at the bottom, while the top concept has no attributes common
to all collections (Fig.  3).
OntologyGen then mapped FCA findings into ontology constructs:
11 OWL classes plus the root Thing, object properties for detected
relations (e.g., AlbumToTrack, CustomerToInvoice), and datatype prop-
erties for attributes like Name, Title, and Email. Subclass relations also
emerged, such as Genre and MediaType under Track (Fig.  4).
The generated ontology graph confirmed these relationships, with
Thing at the top and domain classes beneath; connections such as
InvoiceLineToInvoice and AlbumToTrack are clearly represented (Fig.
5).
Finally, the system exported an OWL file containing all classes
and properties with correct domains and ranges. Imported into Pro-
tégé [18], the ontology rendered properly and passed consistency
checks. Listing 1 shows a preview of the file.

This example demonstrates how OntologyGen converts a multi-
collection MongoDB dataset into a structured ontology that captures
hierarchies and inter-collection relationships with minimal user inter-
action.
8. Evaluation
To evaluate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of Ontol-
ogyGen, it was applied to two MongoDB datasets that had different
complexity and structure: the Chinook database, and the more complex
Sample Training dataset provided by MongoDB Atlas.

8.1. Dataset overview
• Chinook Dataset: A structured music-related dataset with 11
collections and about 9,000 documents, including schemas for
Artists, Albums, and Tracks.
• Sample Training Dataset: A larger, semi-structured business
dataset with 9 collections (e.g., customers, orders, invoices), over
40,000 documents, and mixed schemas modeling real-world ap-
plications.
8.2. Evaluation objectives
The evaluation focuses on the following dimensions:
• Ontology Accuracy: measuring the fidelity of the OWL file to the
underlying MongoDB schema;
• Ontology Complexity: numerically representing the complexity
of the OWL meaning the number of classes, individuals, datatype
properties, object properties, and disjoint axioms generated;
• Performance Metrics: measuring execution time, memory, and
the size of the generated OWL file;

• Tool Robustness: the tool’s performance in inconsistent schema
and in the presence of nested/noisy structures.
8.3. Comparative results
All tests were run on a local machine with 32 GB RAM and Intel
i7 processor. Measurements were collected using Python’s time and
tracemalloc modules integrated into the web application.
8.4. Performance metrics analysis
To evaluate the scalability and performance of OntologyGen, we
examined performance on two data sets of varying size and complexity
(Chinook database and Sample Training). We examined execution time,
memory used, CPU usage, and OWL ontology file size.
As shown in Table  1 and Fig.  6, OntologyGen scales linearly, and
it shows efficient performance across data sets of different sizes. For
the Chinook dataset the ontology generation process was completed in
7.27 s, using 0.29 MB of memory (marginal overhead), and generating
an ontology of 3956.13 KB. Meanwhile, when applied to a much larger
data set (Sample Training) the system completed in 26.36 s, consuming
705.84 MB of memory, and generated an ontology of 88260.66 KB.
In both cases, OntologyGen recorded 0.0% CPU usage, suggesting it
is ultimately memory-bound, and the tool is able to run on standard
computing environments.
The performance chart (Fig.  6) demonstrates a clear indication of
the proposed system’s scalability. The ontology size increase and mem-
ory consumption between datasets is linear against the more structural
complexity and volume of documents. The growth rates of all aspects of
OntologyGen confirms its ability to efficiently handle both light-weight,

and mid-sized datasets, with no measurable degradation in system
responsiveness and stability. The findings further substantiate the tool’s
feasibility for a practical usage in any scenario where schema-less,
semi-structured data is commonplace.
9. Impact and discussion
OntologyGen offers a practical framework to generate OWL ontolo-
gies from unstructured or semi-structured MongoDB data. By combin-
ing Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) with rule-based mapping, it en-
ables users without ontology engineering expertise to extract semantic
structures from schemaless NoSQL databases.
We evaluated OntologyGen on two datasets: the Chinook database
and the larger Sample Training dataset (> 40,000 documents in 9 col-
lections). In both cases, OntologyGen produced valid OWL ontologies
with class hierarchies, datatype and object properties, relationships,
and instances. Performance metrics (memory, execution time, ontology
size) confirmed robustness across varying data scales.
Compared to Cb2Onto [9] and C2Ont [10]—platform-specific and
schema-dependent—OntologyGen provides a flexible web-based solu-
tion for any NoSQL source. FCA’s pattern-based inference supports
adaptive, data-driven ontology construction. Its interactive ‘‘what you
see is what you get’’ design makes results accessible to researchers,
professionals, and non-experts with limited Semantic Web knowledge.
Transparency is enhanced: users can trace the process from database
import to OWL export, with visibility into intermediate results (formal
context, lattice, rules, OWL preview). This benefits both automation
and manual refinement.
Ontologies are OWL-compliant and usable with tools such as Pro-
tégé [18], that enables the reasoning and semantic checking capabilities
to be used. An open-source project (MIT license) allows for customiza-
tion for research and commercial use and can be augmented by fuzzy
FCA [19], distributed computation [20], and relationship mappings.
To conclude, OntologyGen provides the sweet spot for automation,
transparency, and extensibility, not for rigid schemas, but rather the
ontology can create knowledge from the data itself therefore, the
possibility for the transformation can cover a wide selection of domains.
OntologyGen provides a flexible pipeline for transforming NoSQL data
into structured, semantic knowledge, provided with the opportunity to
foster more widespread Semantic Web usage.
10. Conclusion and future work
OntologyGen is a simple and lightweight web-based approach to
ontology generation from NoSQL databases using Formal Concept Anal-
ysis (FCA). Our approach is an end-to-end workflow process that ranges
from context extraction and exported into OWL. We have validated our
approach on a small dataset (Chinook) and a larger dataset (Sample
Training) with a focus on usability and scalability.
The main contributions of OntologyGen are:
• Automatic ontology learning from MongoDB, an underserved data
model in ontology engineering.
• An FCA-driven method to derive concept hierarchies and rela-
tions.
• An intuitive web interface lowering barriers for non-experts.
• Standard OWL outputs enabling Semantic Web interoperability.
Future improvements include enhancements to the mapping rules
for more flexibility, machine learning that would aid in inferring
and/or pruning relations, and support for more databases. Advanced
FCA extensions would also improve the overall adaptability of On-
tologyGen. Examples include fuzzy FCA [15], relational context fam-
ilies [16], and fuzzy relational context families [17].
OntologyGen is connecting schema-less NoSQL data structure with
semantic representations, and it is an open and transparent platform
that has the potential to become a reference tool assisting in ontology
learning/processes in different domains.

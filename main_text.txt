Abstract
MedImages.jl is a Julia library designed to standardize the handling of 3D
and 4D medical imaging data, such as CT, MRI, and PET scans. By pro-
viding a unified data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Struc-
ture (BIDS), MedImages.jl addresses the complexities associated with diverse
medical imaging formats like DICOM and NIfTI. The library facilitates the
loading, saving, and manipulation of medical images while rigorously preserv-
ing critical spatial metadata (origin, spacing, and orientation). It leverages
Julia’s high-performance capabilities to offer efficient spatial transformations
and integrates with the broader ecosystem, including Python-based tools via
PyCall. MedImages.jl aims to democratize access to advanced medical im-
age processing by simplifying the interaction with complex metadata and
fostering reproducible research.

1. Motivation and significance
1.1. How Julia helps in scientific computing
Julia is a high-level, dynamic programming language specifically designed
to bridge the gap between easy-to-use, productive languages like Python, R,
and MATLAB, and high-performance execution languages like C, C++, and5
Fortran [1, 2]. It helps researchers by providing a robust environment suitable
for a wide range of scientific and technical computing needs [1, 3].
The language’s design focuses on overcoming major systemic challenges.
A primary goal is solving the “Two-Language Problem,” where researchers
traditionallyprototypeinhigh-productivitylanguagesbutmustrewriteperformance-10
critical sections in low-level languages [4, 5, 6]. Julia combines the ease of a
productivity language with the speed of a performance language in a single
environment, eliminating this need [6, 5]. Additionally, Julia solves the “Ex-
pression Problem” through multiple dispatch, allowing developers to easily
add new functions to existing data types or integrate new custom data types15
with existing algorithms without modifying original code [1, 4, 7].
2Juliaactslikeauniversaladapterinscientificcomputing, streamliningthe
workflow from initial idea to high-performance production code. Its ecosys-
tem includes specialized packages for scientific machine learning (SciML),
biological sciences (BioJulia), and medical imaging [1, 7].20
1.2. Potential for Julia in medical image analysis
Julia presents significant potential for transforming the analysis of medi-
cal images by combining high performance with developer productivity. This
is demonstrated through unique, domain-specific libraries. For instance,
in MRI reconstruction, packages like MRIReco.jl and KomaMRI.jl achieve25
speeds comparable to established, highly optimized C/C++ libraries [5, 8].
GIRFReco.jl provides an end-to-end, self-contained solution for spiral MRI
reconstruction [9], and BlochSimulators.jl offers highly optimized simulations
[8].
The language’s high performance enables new scientific methods, such as30
rapid parameter estimation in quantitative MRI, which has shown drastic
reductions in computational cost compared to MATLAB implementations
(e.g., 90x speed boost for whole brain fitting), making advanced parame-
ters accessible in clinical settings [10, 11]. Furthermore, Julia’s support for
automatic differentiation (AD) facilitates the rapid implementation and op-35
timization of complex mathematical models [12].
1.3. Difficulties related to medical imaging formats
Handling medical imaging data involves navigating the complexities of
formats like DICOM and the critical nature of spatial metadata. The DI-
COM standard is ubiquitous but criticized for its elaborate structure and40
complexity [13]. Accessing spatial metadata is often error-prone due to the
highly nested and interdependent structure of annotations within DICOM
datasets [13].
Amajorchallengeliesinhandlingspatialcoordinatesandreferenceframes.
Medical images often have varying voxel spacing (non-isotropic pixels) and45
lackauniversalcoordinatesystem[14,15]. Thephysicalrelationshipbetween
image data and patient anatomy—defined by origin, spacing, and a direction
cosine matrix—must be preserved [14]. Ignoring this critical physical spatial
information causes simple operations like adding two images together to be
invalid [14]. Furthermore, registering images with different domains requires50
precise resampling and coordinate alignment [16].
32. Software description
MedImages.jl addresses these challenges by providing a standardized,
high-performance library for medical image handling in Julia.
2.1. Architecture55
The library is organized into modular components, designed to separate
concerns between data representation, I/O, and processing (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Architecture of MedImages.jl showing the core data structure and interacting
modules. This diagram illustrates the relationship between the core data structure (Med-
Image_data_struct), input/output operations (Load_and_save), transformation mod-
ules (Basic_transformations, Spatial_metadata_change), and external ecosystem inte-
gration (PyCall/SimpleITK).
• MedImage_data_struct: Definesthecore MedImage structure, which
encapsulates voxel data, spatial metadata (origin, spacing, direction),
and image classification types. The metadata structure is loosely based60
on the BIDS format.
4• Load_and_save: Handles input/output operations for standard for-
mats like NIfTI (via Nifti.jl) and DICOM (via Dicom.jl).
• Basic_transformations: Provides functions for image manipulation
such as rotation, cropping, and padding.65
• Spatial_metadata_change: Manages critical spatial operations, in-
cluding resampling to new spacings and changing orientation (e.g., to
RAS).
2.2. Functionality
MedImages.jl simplifies the complexity of medical image formats. It al-70
lows users to load images from disparate sources into a unifiedMedImage
object. Key functionalities include:
• StandardizedI/O:seamlessloadingandsavingof3Dand4Ddatasets.
• Spatial Awareness: The library enforces the physical space tenet,
ensuring that operations respect the image’s physical location and ori-75
entation.
• Resampling: Tools to resample images to specific voxel spacings or
reference images, handling interpolation automatically.
• Integration: Through PyCall.jl, it can leverage established tools
like SimpleITK, bridging the gap between Julia’s emerging ecosystem80
and existing high-performance libraries.
3. Illustrative Examples
The following example demonstrates how to load a medical image, resam-
ple it to a standard isotropic spacing, and save the result. This workflow is
common in preprocessing pipelines for machine learning.85
using MedImages
# Load an image (NIfTI or DICOM)
im_path = "path/to/image.nii.gz"
med_img = load_image(im_path)90
5# Inspect current spacing
println("Original Spacing: ", med_img.spacing)
# Resample to isotropic 1x1x1 mm spacing95
target_spacing = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
resampled_img = resample_to_spacing(med_img, target_spacing)
# Save the processed image
save_med_image(resampled_img, "output_isotropic.nii.gz")100
4. Impact
4.1. Positive Impact on the Scientific Community
The development and adoption of MedImages.jl are poised to have a
substantial positive impact on the scientific community, particularly for re-
searchers in medical imaging and computational biology.105
Enhancing Reproducibility.Reproducibilityisacornerstoneofscientificprogress,
yet it remains a challenge in medical imaging due to proprietary formats and
opaque processing pipelines. MedImages.jl enhances reproducibility by pro-
viding an open-source, standardized framework where every step of the image
processing pipeline—from loading to spatial transformation—is transparent110
and code-based [17]. By relying on explicit spatial metadata management,
the library reduces the risk of "silent errors" (such as misaligned coordinate
systems) that can invalidate research findings.
Accelerating Discovery via the Two-Language Solution.Scientific innovation
isoftenslowedbytheneedtotranslateprototypecode(writteninPython/MATLAB)115
into high-performance languages (C++) for deployment. MedImages.jl lever-
agesJulia’sabilitytosolvethe"Two-LanguageProblem,"allowingresearchers
to write high-level, mathematically expressive code that compiles to machine-
native performance [5]. This acceleration allows for more rapid iteration of
algorithms, faster processing of large datasets (like 4D fMRI or PET series),120
and the ability to deploy research code directly into production environments
without rewriting it [3].
Democratizing Access to Advanced Tools.Historically, robust medical image
processing has required deep expertise in C++ (e.g., ITK) or reliance on ex-
pensive proprietary software. MedImages.jl democratizes access by wrapping125
6complex functionalities—such as precise spatial resampling and orientation
management—into intuitive Julia functions. This lowers the barrier to en-
try for biologists, clinicians, and data scientists, allowing them to perform
sophisticated image analysis without needing to be experts in software en-
gineering [18]. Furthermore, its integration with the Python ecosystem via130
PyCall ensures that users can transition gradually, leveraging existing tools
like SimpleITK while adopting Julia’s performance benefits [14].
Fostering a Collaborative Ecosystem. By adhering to open standards and
open-sourcelicensing(Apache2.0), MedImages.jlencouragescommunitycon-
tribution. It serves as a foundational block upon which more specialized tools135
(e.g., for tumor segmentation, registration, or radiomics) can be built. This
modularity fosters a collaborative ecosystem where improvements in the core
library immediately benefit all downstream applications, accelerating the col-
lective pace of innovation in the field [17].
5. Conclusions140

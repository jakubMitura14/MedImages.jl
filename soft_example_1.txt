The PyQt framework facilitates the development of desktop applications, offering an effective environment
for implementing scientific algorithms while leveraging the flexibility of Python. In this paper, we introduce
FQSHA, a PyQt5-based application designed to streamline the workflow of fault-based Seismic Activity
Rate (SAR) calculation and seismic hazard assessment. The primary aim is to provide a unified and user-
friendly interface that makes these processes more accessible. FQSHA enables users to perform hazard
calculations and map the results from scratch using minimal input data and requiring only basic knowledge
of hazard computation engines. The SAR calculation core (FaultQuake) is seamlessly integrated with the
hazard assessment engine (OpenQuake), offering additional flexibility to customize input parameters for hazard
analysis. This integration supports an end-to-end workflow within a single software utilizing a user-friendly
GUI. We present the architecture of FQSHA and demonstrate its capabilities through a hands-on example,
which is publicly available on GitHub.

1. Motivation and significance
Effective fault-based PSHA requires advanced models to incorporate
evolving geometrical and kinematic fault parameters for accurately
estimating the faults’ activity rates and corresponding uncertainties.
On the other hand, with the continuous advancement of active fault
databases—through geodetic observations, earthquake detection, and
location by deep learning [1–4]—and improved knowledge of slip rates
and geometrical attributes of faults, there is a growing need for more

efficient fault-based hazard modeling tools to keep pace with ongoing
updates to these datasets. In this regard, there has been extensive re-
search in this field, resulting in the development of various frameworks
and tools.
Frameworks are being improved to better incorporate fault hazard
models into PSHA. In relation to this, OpenSHA [5] was introduced
as an extensible framework for seismic hazard analysis and has been
pivotal in implementing complex models such as UCERF3 [6], which

integrates geological, geodetic, and seismic data to generate time-
independent earthquake rupture forecasts for California. While Open-
SHA offers a robust platform for seismic hazard analysis, it has certain
limitations: it requires high-quality and extensive input data, limiting
its applicability in data-scarce regions; it involves computationally
intensive models that demand expert configuration; and its Java-based
implementation blackfaces compatibility with modern Python-based
workflows.
More recently, the ESHM20 framework presented by [7] intro-
duced the 2020 European Seismic Hazard Model (ESHM20). This model
presents a hybrid framework that integrates fault-based sources with
smoothed background seismicity across the Euro-Mediterranean re-
gion. The model incorporates the European Fault-Source Model 2020
(EFSM20), comprising 1248 crustal faults and four subduction systems,
and applies a deterministic approach to estimate seismic activity rates
from geological or geodetic slip rates via moment conservation, without
statistical fitting. Faults are modeled as unsegmented composite sources
capable of generating ruptures anywhere along their surface. Seismicity
in areas without mapped faults is represented using adaptive kernel
smoothing within tectonic zones, with activity parameters derived from
Gutenberg–Richter distributions. The model is implemented using the
OpenQuake-engine, leveraging its logic-tree capabilities to propagate
epistemic uncertainties. This study highlights the usefulness of Open-
Quake’s fault modeling for seismic hazard assessment, especially in
contexts where input data is available but limited. It also underscores
the importance of SAR estimation for each fault source as a critical step
in hazard modeling.
Several tools have been developed to facilitate fault-based PSHA
by converting geological and kinematic fault parameters into seis-
mic activity rates suitable for hazard modeling. FiSH [8] estimates
earthquake recurrence parameters using fault slip rates and scaling
relationships, producing time-independent seismicity rates as input for
hazard models. SUNFiSH and FRESH [9] extend this approach by
incorporating logic-tree structures to explore epistemic uncertainties in
fault parameters such as slip rate, maximum magnitude, and recurrence
model. These tools allow for multiple recurrence models, including
characteristic and truncated Gutenberg–Richter distributions. SHER-
IFS [10] enables the construction of fault-based earthquake rupture
forecasts by defining possible rupture geometries, recurrence parame-
ters, and spatial distributions, with support for time-dependent models.
While these tools efficiently generate source models for integration
into platforms like OpenQuake, they typically stop at the activity rate
or source model generation stage and require separate workflows for
hazard computation and visualization.
The most recent tool, FaultQuake [11], incorporates SCC into the
SAR calculation process. A significant feature of this software is its
ability to operate on a simple dataset including geometrical speci-
fications, slip rates, and observed earthquakes to compute SAR. It
also distinguishes between seismic and aseismic deformation, a critical
factor in understanding the behavior of active faults [12]. Although this
tool performs SAR calculation, it is not a comprehensive solution for
hazard calculation or hazard mapping.
On the hazard calculation side, the OpenQuake engine [13], pro-
moted by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation, provides
a platform that facilitates fault-based hazard modeling and serves as
a multi-purpose tool for seismic hazard assessment. However, Open-
Quake does not compute seismic activity rates; instead, it requires the
user to supply the seismic moment rate or MFD for each fault source.
These platforms often require users to be proficient in compiling
at least two different software packages written in various program-
ming languages and handling different input formats (e.g., .txt, XML,
.ini files). Additionally, mapping the output PoE and visualizing the
hazard distribution along fault traces, as well as comparing results
with fault’s mapped trace, are final steps that can be challenging and
time-consuming—especially for students, educators, and researchers.
Fault-based hazard maps are typically developed in three steps: (1)
compiling fault datasets and calculating activity rates, (2) preparing in-
puts for hazard engines like OpenQuake, and (3) mapping the resulting
hazard to evaluate the hazard potential of each fault using tools like
GMT, or QGIS. The motivation for developing our integrated workflow,
FQSHA, which includes a graphical user interface (GUI), stems from
the need for a versatile and open-source tool that consolidates all these
steps. FQSHA processes basic input data in JSON format, including fault
geometry, slip rates, and historical seismicity, to calculate SAR, gener-
ate necessary hazard parameters, integrate them with OpenQuake, and
visualize fault-based hazard maps. It is designed to enable rapid testing
of alternative fault segmentation and moment-rate scenarios. The GUI
provides intuitive access to all features, facilitating rapid exploration
and scenario testing for both experienced researchers and new users in
seismic hazard analysis.
2. Software description
This section presents the theoretical background and structural
design of the FQSHA tool. The significance of the FQSHA tool in the
context of current literature lies in its ability to unify the workflow for
fault-based seismic hazard analysis. Its main contributions include:
• FQSHA eliminates the need for time-consuming tasks such as
preparing and analyzing inputs for various tools and packages by
requiring only a single JSON file containing fault specifications,
thereby removing the burden of manually handling complex input
formats.
• The automated handling of XML and JSON files streamlines data
processing and minimizes errors, thereby enhancing the efficiency
of fault-based seismic modeling.
• Integrating SAR computation directly within the framework, re-
moving the dependency on a software to calculate seismic activity
rates and exporting the Activity Rate (AR)s to be compatible by
another software.
• Enhancing accessibility to fault-based hazard analysis by enabling
direct computation of seismic hazard from fault models within a
single environment.
• Providing built-in functionality to generate fault-specific hazard
maps, thereby accelerating the evaluation of multiple hazard
scenarios.
2.1. Software functionality
The core functionality of this Python-based graphical interface lies
in the integration of fault SAR modeling (based on the methodol-
ogy introduced by [11]) with the OpenQuake hazard computation
engine [13], allowing for the direct generation of fault-based seismic
hazard maps (Fig. 1).
The primary objective of this method to realistically incorporate
the physical characteristics of active faults into hazard models. This
involves leveraging available geological and geophysical data, such as
fault geometry (length, dip, seismogenic thickness), slip rates (min-
imum and maximum), and earthquake history (observed magnitude
(𝑀𝑜𝑏𝑠) and its associated Standard Deviation (SD), to estimate the
likelihood and impact of potential earthquakes. In this context, FQSHA
utilizes an advanced SAR calculation engine that also accepts optional
inputs such as the Seismic Coupling Coefficient (SCC) to partition the
total deformation into seismic and aseismic components (see Table 4).
These geometrical and kinematic attributes are used to derive five
different Empirical Magnitude (EM) estimates. Through Conflation of
Probabilities (CoP) that also incorporates 𝑀𝑜𝑏𝑠, the maximum expected
earthquake magnitude (Maximum Magnitude (𝑀𝑚𝑎𝑥)) and its uncer-
tainty (𝜎) are computed. The total moment rate is calculated by in-
tegrating 𝑀max, 𝜎, and the mean recurrence interval 𝑇mean, which is

Activity Rate (SAR) and Hazard calculation, and GMT mapping toolkit.
derived using the segment seismic moment conservation principle [14].
This moment rate is then balanced across a range of magnitudes
between 𝑀𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑀max, using relative activity models such as the
Truncated Gutenberg–Richter (Truncated Gutenberg-Richter (TGR)) or
Characteristic Gaussian Distribution (Characteristic Gaussian Distribu-
tion (CGD)) models. The result is a complete SAR distribution for
each fault, which forms the basis for subsequent hazard computations.
Further methodological details are available in [11].
To perform the seismic hazard analysis, FQSHA interfaces directly
with the OpenQuake engine. Fault-based PSHA in OpenQuake is per-
formed by explicitly modeling individual seismogenic fault sources
using their geometric, kinematic, and history of earthquakes. Each fault
is defined as a complex polygonal surface or a simple planar geometry
with associated parameters such as slip rate, rake, dip, and seismogenic
depth range. Rather than estimating seismic activity rates from earth-
quake catalogs, OpenQuake requires the user to provide fault-specific
moment rates or magnitude–frequency distributions (MFDs), often de-
rived from geological or geodetic slip rates under the assumption of
moment conservation [13,15]. Fault ruptures are generated stochas-
tically across the fault surface according to empirical magnitude-area
scaling relationships and user-defined rupture scenarios [16,17]. These
ruptures serve as inputs to ground motion prediction equations (GM-
PEs) within a logic-tree framework that enables systematic propagation
of epistemic uncertainties. OpenQuake then computes hazard curves,
maps, and uniform hazard spectra by aggregating the PoE at defined
site locations.
2.2. Fault and hazard input data
The input data requirements necessary to initiate the software’s pro-
cessing workflow are a primary input file containing a comprehensive
set of mandatory parameters, as well as optional inputs that may be

provided through the GUI. After computing the AR of the faults, the
software automatically generates the essential files required for the haz-
ard calculation step. All input data must be prepared in JSON format,
with the following attributes specified for each fault: ScR (Scale Re-
lationship code; see Table 1), year_for_calculations, Length
(in kilometers), Dip (in degrees), upperSeismoDepth and lower-
SeismoDepth (upper and lower seismogenic depths, in kilometers),
SRmin and SRmax (minimum and maximum slip rates from geo-
logic or geodetic sources), Mobs (maximum observed magnitude), sd-
Mobs (standard deviation of Mobs), Last_eq_time (year of occur-
rence of Mobs), SCC (Seismic Coupling Coefficient), ShearModulus,
StrainDrop, Mmin (minimum magnitude threshold for inclusion
in hazard calculations), b-value, and fault_trace (coordinates
representing the mapped trace of the fault). The structure of this input
format is discussed in Section 3.
OpenQuake supports two primary modes for fault-based PSHA:
classical and event-based, which can be selected via the hazard calcu-
lation panel of the GUI. In the classical mode, the software computes
ground motion levels corresponding to specified probabilities of ex-
ceedance (PoE) by integrating over all possible earthquake ruptures

and their associated annual occurrence rates. For fault-based mod-
els, these ruptures are derived from fault geometry, slip rates, and
magnitude–frequency distributions, with ground motions estimated us-
ing the selected Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPE). The
outputs typically include hazard curves, hazard maps, and uniform haz-
ard spectra. In contrast, the event-based mode employs a Monte Carlo
simulation approach to generate thousands of synthetic earthquake
catalogs over a user-defined time window. Each event is stochastically
sampled from the fault model, and corresponding ground motion fields
are calculated at the defined sites of interest. The spatial extent of the
hazard calculation region is defined by the user through the hazard
panel, where the coordinates of the four bounding corners are specified.
This region constrains the faults to be included in the simulation. Alter-
natively, if left unspecified, the extent is automatically computed based
on the traces of the input faults. Additional user-defined parameters
include the spacing between grid points (grid resolution), the shear-
wave velocity (𝑉𝑠30), and the scaling relationship code used for rupture
generation (see Table 2). By default, the software uses the WC1994
scaling relationship [18] for hazard calculations.
In the OpenQuake Engine hazard workflow, GMPEs are essential
components that quantify the relationship between earthquake source
characteristics (e.g., magnitude, distance, faulting mechanism) and
site conditions (e.g., shear-wave velocity, 𝑉𝑠30) with ground motion
intensity measures such as PGA and Spectral Acceleration (SA). These
models are incorporated into the hazard calculation via logic trees,
enabling the inclusion of multiple GMPEs with user-defined weights to
account for epistemic uncertainty. Each GMPE is linked to a specific
tectonic region type (e.g., active shallow crust, subduction interface),
and OpenQuake supports the combination of different models to com-
pute hazard curves, hazard maps, and uniform hazard spectra. The
selection and weighting of GMPEs play a critical role in shaping hazard
estimates and should be tailored to the regional seismotectonic setting.
The tool provides a library of 22 GMPE options (Table 3) that users can
configure and weight through the GUI. Based on the selected models
and weights, the software automatically generates the required logic
tree files for subsequent hazard computations.
2.3. Software architecture
The algorithm in 1, together with the conceptual diagram in Fig. 1,
outlines the sequential workflow of the FQSHA software, including its
inputs, outputs, and the core functions invoked at each stage. These
core computational routines implement widely accepted models in
fault-based seismic hazard analysis.
Input data and optional parameters provided via the GUI are used
to compute 𝑀max and 𝜎𝑀max and to address epistemic uncertainty
in magnitude estimates, the conflate_pdfs() function combines
multiple probability density functions (PDFs) into a single conflated
distribution using a normalized geometric mean approach. 𝑇mean is
estimated from the seismic moment rate and the expected moment
release per event, based on the derived 𝑀max and associated rupture
parameters. For the moment budget calculation the kin2coeff()
and coeff2mag() functions retrieve and apply empirical magnitude
scaling relationships, based on fault rupture length, area, and aspect
ratio [17,18,21].
The algorithm 2 details the implementation of seismic activity
rate (SAR) modules within FQSHA. The subsequent step utilizes the
sactivityrate module to calculate the total moment and redis-
tribute it across the magnitude range between 𝑀min and 𝑀max for
SAR computation. For modeling seismic activity rates, the software
supports both characteristic and Gutenberg–Richter formulations. The
CHGaussPoiss() and CHGaussBPT() functions implement a char-
acteristic Gaussian magnitude model paired with time-independent
(Poisson) and time-dependent (Brownian Passage Time, BPT) recur-
rence models, respectively [46]. Alternatively, the TruncatedGR()
function applies a truncated Gutenberg–Richter distribution using
SoftwareX 32 (2025) 102339

moment-balance constraints and fault-specific 𝑏 values. SARs are then
passed to the OpenQuake engine to generate seismic hazard maps
corresponding to 10% and 2% PoE. Finally, the results are visualized
using the GMT Python toolkit, which produces detailed hazard map
plots.

• GMPEs are assigned to specific Tectonic Region Types, such as
Active Shallow Crust.
• Multiple GMPEs can be combined using a logic tree structure,
which allows for incorporating epistemic uncertainty in ground-
motion modeling.
• Each GMPE branch is assigned a weight that reflects its relative
applicability or expert-assigned credibility. These weights must
sum to exactly 1.0 within each branch set.
The FQSHA GUI allows users to configure GMPEs for use with the
OpenQuake engine as follows:
• Users can select one or more GMPEs using checkboxes within the
graphical interface.
• For each selected GMPE, the user may optionally input a custom
weight. If no value is provided, a default of 1.0 is assumed.
• The GUI automatically normalizes the weights of all selected
GMPEs to ensure the sum equals 1.0, as required by OpenQuake.
• A logic tree file (gmpe_logic_tree.xml) is generated, defin-
ing the GMPE branch set with the specified models and weights
in the NRML format.
• This logic tree file is referenced in the OpenQuake job configura-
tion (job.ini) and used during the hazard calculation.
By executing the main code, GUI (Fig. 2) reads the input file

The computed hazard maps are rendered within the user-defined
geographic extent using the GMT toolkit, illustrating ground motion
levels corresponding to 10% (Fig. 4(a)) and 2% (Fig. 4(b)) PoE. In
addition, the resulting hazard data are available for visualization using
external mapping tools.
4. Software testing and verification
To ensure the correctness and reliability of FQSHA’s core function-
alities, we utilized Python’s built-in unittest framework [47] along
with the coverage.py tool for code coverage analysis. This approach
improves software stability and minimizes the risk of errors according
to [48] and is effective in validating Python-based scientific software
components.
4.1. Automated GUI testing with pytest-qt
For GUI testing in PyQt5 applications, the pytest-qt plugin
extends pytest to support interaction-based testing. This tool enables
developers to simulate user actions, verify UI responsiveness, and assess
the functionality and stability of the GUI without manual interven-
tion [49]. These tests replicate user interactions — such as parameter
selection, button clicks, and computation triggers — to ensure the GUI
behaves as expected. Moreover, this testing approach verifies the GUI’s
ability to invoke core functions and generate outputs, including input
data handling, 𝑀𝑚𝑎𝑥 computation, seismic activity rate calculation,
visualization of the annual cumulative moment budget, EMs plots with
𝑀𝑚𝑎𝑥 annotations, and successful integration with OpenQuake. The
outcomes are compiled into a comprehensive test report.

4.2. Unit testing for core functions
Unit testing was also applied to critical functions within FQSHA,
particularly those responsible for SAR calculations and input/out-
put data handling. The pytest framework was utilized to auto-
mate testing, enabling verification of expected outputs under various
input conditions. All test cases are implemented as Python classes
inheriting from unittest.TestCase, and they can be executed
using the unittest test runner (e.g., via python -m unittest
tests/test_sample.py -v).
4.3. Code coverage analysis
To assess the thoroughness of our testing efforts, we used the
coverage.py tool [50], which measures the percentage of source
code executed by the test suite, helping to identify untested code and
improve overall robustness. For the GUI test code
(tests/test_gui.py), out of 76 statements only 3 were missed, re-
sulting in an overall coverage of 96%. For the core functions and data-
handling tests (tests/test_sactivityrate_xmlExport.py),
60 statements were evaluated with 4 missed, corresponding to an
overall coverage of 93%. The tool provides detailed reports including
statement coverage and highlights untested blocks in an interactive
HTML format. All test scripts and configurations are included in the
source code repository. The tests can be executed in any Python envi-
ronment with minimal setup and can be automatically run using the
coverage.py test runner (e.g., via coverage run -m unittest
tests/test_guiii.py -v).
5. Impact
The FQSHA tool serves as a comprehensive and streamlined frame-
work for fault-based seismic hazard analysis, transforming raw fault
input data into final hazard estimates with minimal user intervention.
By integrating the Seismic Activity Rate (SAR) computation engine
(FaultQuake) with the widely used hazard calculation platform (Open-
Quake), FQSHA provides an environment tailored for Probabilistic
Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) directly from fault sources. The tool
is automated and designed with usability in mind, making it accessible
to both experts and new users to the geoscience community. Given its
ease of use and efficiency in addressing a critical aspect of seismic
hazard assessment, we expect it to attract a broad range of users
and applications. Its utility and user-centered design are expected to
encourage frequent use, broad adoption, and noticeable impact within
the field.
6. Conclusions
The development of FQSHA addresses the need for a transparent
and accessible tool to support research and education in fault-based
PSHA. It streamlines the modeling process by enabling users to perform
fault-based hazard calculations with minimal manual input. The toolkit
integrates a graphical interface for computing fault-based SAR, which
is directly coupled with the OpenQuake Engine for hazard computa-
tions and the GMT toolkit for visualizing hazard maps. Its modular
architecture supports ongoing development and customization. Planned
extensions include the incorporation of advanced SAR models and addi-
tional hazard computation methodologies, as well as tighter integration
with OpenQuake’s latest features. Future work will also explore vali-
dation using established benchmarks such as GEM datasets. Given its
design and flexibility, FQSHA holds potential for application in national
seismic hazard studies and educational training, and may be extended
toward supporting early warning and decision-support systems.
